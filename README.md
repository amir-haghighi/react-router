## Video Tutorials

I created this example by following two video tutorials:

1. **Playlist of 11 Videos by The Net Ninja**: This playlist served as the foundation for my understanding. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMQ2QARHPo0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iVKmtNuCeIswnQ97in2GGf).

2. **Single Video by Web Dev Simplified**: This video provided additional insights and helped me enhance my project. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTIJunBa6MA).

3. **now it is the time to get to the deep** : lets look at the react router dom itself [here]( [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).
